## 🎯 Problem Statement

BlinkIT manages diverse grocery outlets with large volumes of transaction data, but lacks a consolidated view of outlet-wise performance, item-wise sales trends, and customer engagement metrics. This project aims to solve that by:

- Analyzing total and average sales across outlet types and product categories
- Understanding consumer preferences through item type and fat content breakdown
- Evaluating outlet establishment trends and geographic sales performance
